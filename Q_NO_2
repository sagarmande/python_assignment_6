In the context of escape characters, the escape sequences `\n` and `\t` have specific meanings:

1. `\n` represents the newline character. When encountered in a string or text document, it creates a line break or moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line. This allows you to display or structure text on separate lines.

2. `\t` represents the tab character. It inserts a horizontal tab or indentation into the text. When encountered, it typically moves the cursor to the next tab stop or a predefined number of spaces, depending on the application or context.

These escape sequences are commonly used in programming languages, text editors, and command line interfaces to format and control the layout of text. They provide a way to introduce special characters or control characters that cannot be easily typed directly.
